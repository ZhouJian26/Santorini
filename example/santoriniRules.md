## Setup

The youngest player is the *Start Player*, who begins by placing 2 Workers of their chosen color into any unoccupied spaces on the board. The other player(s) then places their Workers.


## How To Play

- Players take turns, starting with the Start Player, who first placed their Workers. On your turn, select one of your Workers.  
You *must move* and then *build* with the selected Worker.
- **Move** your selected Worker into one of the (up to) eight neighboring spaces.  
- A Worker may *move up* a maximum of one level higher, *move down* any number of levels lower, or *move along* the same level. A Worker *may not move up more than one level*.
- The space your Worker moves into must be unoccupied (not containing a Worker or Dome).
- **Build** a block or dome on an unoccupied space neighboring the moved Worker.  
- You can *build* onto a level of any height, but you must choose the correct shape of block or dome for the level being built.  
- A tower with 3 blocks and a dome is considered a “Complete Tower”.


## Winning The Game

- If one of your Workers moves up on top of level 3 during your turn, you instantly win!
- You **must** always perform a move then build on your turn. If you are unable to, you lose.


## God Powers

- The Challenger (determined by who is the most “god-like”) chooses God Powers equal to the number of players.  
- The Challenger reads each selected God Power aloud.  
- In clockwise order, everyone chooses a God Power and places it in their area.  
- The Challenger receives the last God Power.  
- The Challenger chooses a Start Player, who places 2 Workers of their chosen color on any unoccupied spaces on the board. In clockwise order, the other players each place all their Workers.


## Using God Powers

- Normal Rules and conditions still apply to you when using a God Power, with the exception of the specific changes described by the God Power.
- You must obey all God Power text that says you “**cannot**” or “**must**”, otherwise you lose the game.
- *Domes are not blocks*. If the God Power description states it affects blocks, it does not affect domes.
- “**Forced**” is not “**moved**”. Some God Powers may cause Workers to be “forced” into another space. A Worker that is forced, is not considered to have moved.
- *Remember*: to win the game by moving onto the third level, your Worker must move up during your turn. Therefore, if your Worker is **Forced** onto the third level, *you do not win the game*. Moving from one third level space to another also does not trigger a win.
- God Powers apply or are triggered at a specific time, according to what is stated at the start in the God Power’s description. For example, Apollo’s God Power description starts with “*Your Move*”. This means if you possess Apollo’s God Power, it can only be used by you during the “*move*” phase of your turn.
- When using a God Power, all text in its description is written from the perspective of the player possessing the God Power. Any time an “*opponent*” is mentioned in a God Power description, it is referring an opponent of the player possessing the God Power.
- Additional Setup **must be** performed when using some God Powers. If your selected God Power features “Setup” text in the description, execute these special instructions during the game Setup. If the order players perform additional setup gives either player an advantage, execute them in turn order.
- Additional Win Conditions are specified by some God Powers. In addition to being able to win by moving up onto the third level during your turn, you can also win by fulfilling the “Win Condition” described.
